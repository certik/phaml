This illustrates how to solve problems with periodic boundary conditions.
See the section on 3D problems in the user's guide for an explanation of the
bmark values used in subroutine bconds in pde.f90.  In that subroutine you
can choose between periodic in x, periodic in y, and doubly periodic in both
x and y.  For a triply periodic example, see testdir3D/test_prob.
