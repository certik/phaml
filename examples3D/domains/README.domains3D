This example shows how to define 3D domains with Gmsh's .geo files.  The
.msh files are output from Gmsh.  Edit master.f90 to select the domain to use.

If you are solving a problem on the unit cube, you can use unitcube.msh and
you don't need to have Gmsh.  See the section on 3D problems in the User's
Guide for the assignment of boundary markers in this file.
